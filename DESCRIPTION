Description: Implementation of random forests for survival, 
  longitudinal, and multivariate data; modified from randomForestSRC, 
  by Ishwaran and Kogalur. We reproduce their package description 
  here: "A unified treatment of Breiman's random forests for survival, 
  regression and classification problems based on Ishwaran and 
  Kogalur's random survival forests (RSF) package.  Now extended to 
  include multivariate and unsupervised forests.  Also includes 
  quantile regression forests for univariate and multivariate 
  training/testing settings.  The package runs in both serial and 
  parallel (OpenMP) modes."
